days prior to stocking. The three IMCs were stocked
at combined density of 6000 juveniles/ha served as
the control (C). With no change in the IMC density,
juveniles of pengba were stocked additionally at 10%
and 20% in two treatments T-1 and T-2, respectively.
Fingerlings of all the species raised in ICAR-CIFA farm
were stocked in these ponds. The average stocking
sizes of the species were catla (24.3 cm and 232.7 g),
rohu (19.5 cm, 114.4 g), mrigal (20.5 cm, 107.0 g) and
